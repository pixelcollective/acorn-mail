## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Maintainers and contributors to this project acknowledge that none of these protected identities exist in a vacuum; rather, our global economic and social systems have historically been weighted in favor of some at the expense of others. While harassment, bullying, and derogatory comments toward any of these identities are not acceptable, contributors acknowledge these systems of exclusion and oppression, and maintainers will weigh the seriousness of any given offense with these systems in mind.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, **to the extent that the expressions of these viewpoints do not otherwise violate this code of conduct**
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- **Refusal to engage in dialogue and/or mediation about any of the above behavior when called out by other contributors**
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Project maintainers also have the right and responsibility to enforce this code of conduct with regards to behavior in *any* public space, even those wherein the individual is not specifically representing the project, such as on social media, in co-working spaces, at networking events and conferences, and so on. Public behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, regardless of circumstance, sends a message to members of our community that working on projects with the individual in question could be an unpleasant or hostile situation, even if the behavior did not occur while the individual was explicitly representing the project at the time. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to prioritize the future recruitment of members whose behavior will not violate this code of conduct, over the involvement of contributors whose behavior does.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **hello@tinypixel.dev.** All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
